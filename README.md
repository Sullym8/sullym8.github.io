## Introduction

Over the course of our lives, we have begun to see a spike in the number of deaths due to heart diseases. We would like to investigate what variables most impact heart disease in Maryland and if there is a correlation between the amount of physical activity and the likelihood of heart diseases. Additionally, these datasets are published by the Federal and Maryland government which make them credible. The datasets are categorized by age, gender, race and county so we could explore the trends between demographics.
